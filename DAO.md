# Haibu DAO Safety & Governance Plan

*Ensuring Secure, Fair, and Sustainable Decentralized Governance*

## 1. Governance Model & Structure

### 1.1 Progressive Decentralization Approach
- **Phase 1 (Initial Launch - MVP)**
  - Governance controlled by a **multi-sig council** (e.g., 5-7 core members).
  - Community input through off-chain voting (Snapshot, Discourse discussions).
- **Phase 2 (Growth Stage - After MVP)**
  - Introduce **DAO voting with on-chain proposals**.
  - Weight voting power based on **activity reputation + governance tokens**.
- **Phase 3 (Full Decentralization)**
  - Transition full control to **the DAO with a structured proposal and execution system**.

### 1.2 Balanced Voting Mechanism
- Implement **Quadratic Voting** to prevent whale dominance.
- Introduce **soulbound reputation tokens** for governance weight.
- Require **staked governance tokens** for voting power.

### 1.3 Proposal & Decision-Making Process
- **Proposal Submission**: Anyone with governance tokens can submit a proposal.
- **Community Discussion**: Proposals discussed on Haibu forums for at least 7 days.
- **Voting & Execution**: Snapshot-based voting leading to **on-chain execution**.

## 2. Smart Contract Security & Risk Mitigation

### 2.1 Pre-Launch Security Measures
- **Smart Contract Audits**:
  - Conduct security audits by **top-tier blockchain security firms** before deployment.
  - Regular re-audits after major updates.
- **Bug Bounty Program**:
  - Offer financial incentives to white-hat hackers for discovering vulnerabilities.

### 2.2 Governance Attack Prevention
- **Time-Locked Transactions**:
  - Implement a **time delay on critical proposals** to allow community review.
- **Guardrails for Emergency Reversal**:
  - Multi-sig **security council can veto malicious proposals** within a set timeframe.
- **Decentralized Identity Verification**:
  - Introduce **proof-of-participation** or **soulbound tokens** to limit Sybil attacks.

## 3. Tokenomics & DAO Sustainability

### 3.1 Preventing Speculative Attacks
- **Gradual Token Unlocking**:
  - Implement **vesting schedules** to prevent massive token dumping.
- **Stake-Based Governance**:
  - Users must **stake governance tokens for a period** to participate in voting.

### 3.2 Incentivizing Positive Contributions
- **Gamified Reputation System**:
  - Reward long-term participation with **non-transferable governance points**.
- **Penalizing Harmful Behavior**:
  - Introduce **slashing mechanisms** for voting on malicious proposals.

## 4. Compliance & Legal Framework

### 4.1 Regulatory Compliance
- Ensure Haibu **DAO governance is aligned with global regulations** (e.g., DAOs in Wyoming, EU MiCA laws).
- Work with **crypto-legal experts** to create a compliant governance structure.

### 4.2 DAO Governance & Liability
- Define **legal entity structure** (e.g., DAO LLC) for off-chain legal protection.
- Implement **community-enforced rules & code of conduct**.

## 5. Implementation Timeline & Roadmap

| **Phase** | **Key Actions** | **Timeline** |
